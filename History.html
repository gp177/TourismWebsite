                                        The history of Quebec dates as far back as the discovery of Canada itself. It was indeed on her soil that Jacques Cartier, the envoy of the king of France , landed for the first time in 1534. She did not, however, really begin to exist until 1608, when Samuel de Champlain, who had already established a first settlement in Acadia, planted the fleur-de-lis on the rock of Stadacona, and definitely chose Quebec as the seat of what was to be New France for more than a century and a half.
                                        The new colony, which ultimately grew into the present Canada, had very humble beginnings, and for a long time its existence was extremely precarious. So heavy, however, was the toll of lives levied at that time by continuous incursions of Indians that more than once the fate of the colony appeared to be sealed. Relief came at last in 1665 with the timely arrival of the regiment of Carignan. The Indians were kept at bay at least temporarily, and the colonists were for the first time allowed to breathe. A period followed of the most fruitful activity. Under the inspiration of Colbert, then minister of Louis XIV, France had at last decided to inaugurate a real policy of colonization, and the economic direction of the country had been fortunately entrusted to Jean Talon, a man of superior ability known in Canadian history as "the Great Intendant". Settlers.

                                        Towards the end of the seventeenth century, New France was at last internally at peace, the Indians having been sufficiently overpowered or having become friendly as a whole, and the colony could have grown much more rapidly had the home government shown the same interest in its welfare as at the time of Colbert. Progress was considerably hampered by continuous petty quarrels between governors and intendants, whose powers were not well defined; and, as a result of a narrow policy, only a slight encouragement was given to local industry. Besides, the influx of settlers had practically ceased. and the population was left to its natural increase, which was, it is true, wonderfully rapid.
                                        Meanwhile the British settlements were thriving in New England and Virginia, and, as was inevitable, there was soon created between them and New France a certain rivalry which periodically broke out into warring conflicts. In retaliation for the numerous and bloody incursions made with the help of Indians on New England towns, the English twice planned to subdue New France, but without success, firstly in 1690, when Sir William Phips  was repulsed by Frontenac, and secondly in 1711, when Quebec was saved by the wreck of Sir Hovenden Walker's fleet.

                                        After the repelling of the invader, political dissensions were not long in flaming anew between the two rival sections of the community, and in 1791 it was found necessary to frame a second constitution, which like the former one was diversely appreciated. By the new Act the colony was divided into two distinct provinces, namely Lower Canada (or otherwise Quebec ), and Upper Canada (later called Ontario ). Each of the two provinces was at the same time endowed with a legislature consisting of two branches, a Legislative Council and a Legislative Assembly. In Lower Canada particularly, the legislature provided a new field in which were emphasized the differences already existing. The elected representatives of the majority could not go hand in hand with the appointed Council, and each in turn took up the cudgels. There were also innumerable occasions of quarrel between the governors and the representatives of the people. When the Assembly, after having uselessly claimed during many sessions the absolute control of public expenditure, finally refused in 1826 and later to vote the subsidies required by the administration, the situation became acute.
